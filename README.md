# Credit Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to determine the eligibility of individuals for loans based on their financial and personal information. The model is trained using a dataset that includes features such as age, education, work experience, income, etc. The project involves data visualization, data cleaning, and the application of the machine learning algorithm, Logistic Regression.

## Project Structure

All the files are directly stored in the main directory.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook to explore the project's code and analyses.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter notebook to see the step-by-step process of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
2. Modify the code to experiment with different machine learning algorithms or data preprocessing techniques.
3. Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
